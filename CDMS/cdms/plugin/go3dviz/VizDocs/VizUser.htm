    Program Overview:
  </P>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
  <P>
    In the future, the CDMS core program will run this visualisation       program.  Until this happens, however, the visualizer can be run as 
    a Windows/XWindows application.
  </P>

  <P>
    The program takes in numerical data files in a standard format     (comma field separation, new-line record separation) and displays
    random samples of the data in a graph-like visual format.  This
    visual representation can then be manipulated in various ways so
    that patterns in the data can be more readily be identified.

  <P>
    Assuming the program compiled correctly, (if it doesn't,
    <A HREF="mailto:mjm@csse.monash.edu.au">email me</A>!) you should
    be able to run the program with the default test data.
  </P>

  <P>
    To run the program simply type: <B>java GO3DVizPanel</B> at the
    prompt.  This should use the default data file "glass_ok.txt" and      you should see the program window appear.
  </P>

  <P>
    To run the program with your own numerical data:
  </P>

  <UL>
    <LI>
      Put the data into a text file so that the fields are separated
      by commas (,) and the records are separated by new-lines.

    On starting the program you should be presented with a window that

    The window is broken up into 3 sections:

    <LI>The Navigation Panel</LI>
    <LI>The Toolbar</LI>

    These are described in detail below.  If you find that the icons
    for any of the bars are missing, check that the gif files are in
    a subdirectory of the code folder called "images" and that all the
    files have the capitalisation shown in the Program Files section.

          When the program first begins, the default position is very
          close to the origin of the 3D axes.  Hopefully this default           position will be moved in an update of the program, but for
          now you will need to move the camera position back to a
          normal viewing distance.  (See the next section for how!)

          The navigation was based on the simple idea that the less
          buttons, the easier.  There are two sets of buttons which           govern all the 3D movement in the program.
        </P>
        <P>
          The first set of buttons is the pair on the very right of the 
          navigation bar.  These two buttons form a toggle switch that
          chooses whether you are in "Translate Mode" or "Rotate Mode". 
        </P>
        <P>
          In "Translate Mode", the second set of buttons (the six
          directional arrows) <U>move the object</U> in the direction
          of the arrow.
        </P>
        <P>
          In "Rotate Mode" the 6 directional arrows <U>rotate the
          object</U> in the direction of the arrow.
        </P>
        <P>
          <B>Note</B> that all navigation affects the object,
          <U>not</U> the camera position.
